Task 1:
Connect an LED to pin D7 and a buzzer to pin D9.
Modify the code so that:
When fire is detected, the LED turns ON and the buzzer sounds.
When no fire is detected, the LED and buzzer remain OFF.
Keep displaying the sensor values on the serial monitor.

Task 2:
Connect the LCD (I2C module) to the Arduino.
Display:
"Fire Detector" on the first row.
The real-time sensor value on the second row.
If fire is detected:
The LCD should display "FIRE DETECTED!" on the first row.
The buzzer and LED should still function as in Task 2.
