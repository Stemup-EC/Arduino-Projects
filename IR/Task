Task 1: Object Detection with Count
Modify the given code to count the number of times an object is detected. Display the count each time an object is detected.

Hint: Use a variable to store the count and increment it whenever the object is detected. Print the updated count on the serial monitor.

Task 2: House Full Message
After detecting 10 objects, print "House is Full!" instead of the regular count message.

Hint: Use an if condition to check if the count has reached 10. If true, display "House is Full!" and decide whether to reset the count or stop further counting.

Task 3: Home Automation - Automatic Light Control
Modify the code so that when someone enters the room, a light (LED) turns ON, and when no one is detected, the light turns OFF.

ðŸ”¹ Technical Hint:

Connect an LED to a digital pin (e.g., pin 13).
Set the LED pin as OUTPUT in the setup().
When an object is detected (sensorValue == LOW), turn the LED ON (digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH)).
When no object is detected (sensorValue == HIGH), turn the LED OFF (digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW)).
Add a small delay to avoid rapid switching.
