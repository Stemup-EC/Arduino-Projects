Task 1: Object Detection with Count
Modify the given code to count the number of times an object is detected. Display the count each time an object is detected.

Hint: Use a variable to store the count and increment it whenever the object is detected. Print the updated count on the serial monitor.

Task 2: House Full Message
After detecting 10 objects, print "House is Full!" instead of the regular count message.

Hint: Use an if condition to check if the count has reached 10. If true, display "House is Full!" and decide whether to reset the count or stop further counting.
